Getting Started: That includes:

A link to the deployed app (netlify)

Deployed NETLIFY URL: https://main--jolly-boba-94db3b.netlify.app/
The deployment build was successful after making several adjustments to my code and file structure in order for netlify to successfully build and deploy the app. However, so far all attempts to render the app webpage has failed. Console logs show that the splash page file (App.jsx) is being read by netlify, however the return function within the App.jsx file is seemingly not being executed. Troubleshooting is ongoing.

A link to the Trello board used for the project’s planning that includes user stories, wireframes & an ERD.
